    p.headline 
        | My name is 
        strong Christopher Snowhill
        | , or 
        code kode54
        | , and I&apos;ve been writing random software for as long as I&apos;ve had computers with a programming language to tinker with.
        br
        | I am the main developer of 
        a(href='https://cog.losno.co') Cog
        | , an audio player for macOS, and also an occasional contributor to various other free and open source projects, including the Linux kernel.
    p
        | I&apos;ve been tinkering with electronics and computers for most of my life, and I used to (semi-destructively) take things apart, but nowadays, I mostly only repair things as needed. I got my start on an Apple II+, and barely used a Commodore 64, and the IBM PC compatibles belonging to relatives. It would be years before I finally got a PC of my own and actually learned any productive use of programming languages for it.
    p
        | These days, I&apos;d say I&apos;m fairly competent in C/C++, JavaScript, and maybe some PHP, and still have the faint memories of my early use of 6502 and 65816 assembly language.
    p
        | I have made a number of minor contributions to various projects, including a number of console emulators, like 
        a(href='https://www.zsnes.com/') ZSNES
        |  and 
        a(href='http://www.snes9x.com/') Snes9X
        | , and later 
        a(href='https://github.com/higan-emu/higan') higan
        | . I have also contributed several patches to the Linux kernel, some of which are still useful today.
