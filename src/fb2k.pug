    h1 My foobar 2000 components
    .headline I used to maintain a bunch of foobar2000 components, but I #[strong no longer support their community or developers], so I have ceased maintaining them. The repository for all of them, and the top level project containing all of them, are now archived, in case anyone really feels like they could take them over.
    .alert.alert-warning I will #[strong not] update my components to support the new x86_64 version of foobar2000.
