    h1 My foobar 2000 components
    .headline.pb-4 I used to maintain a bunch of components for foobar2000, but I #[strong no longer support its developers and community], so I have ceased maintaining them. The repository for all of them, and the top level project containing all of them, is now archived, in case anyone really feels like they could take them over.
    .alert.alert-warning I will #[strong not] update my components to support the new x86_64 version of foobar2000.
